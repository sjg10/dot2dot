dot2dot
=======
=======

A C++ based program for converting any image file into a vectorized dot to dot picture for your later amusement.

Compilation
===========

Requires [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) to compile.

Just run `make all` to compile an executable into the `bin` folder.
`make clean` does what it says on the tin.

Execution
=========

Requires [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) to run. Hopefully will use static libraries in the future.

The format of the program is `./dot2dot [-l dot_limit] input_file`.
